This repository contains exploratory analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL queries. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from  https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths .


## Overview

The purpose of this project is to gain insights into the COVID-19 pandemic by exploring various aspects of the data. The dataset includes information such as location, date, total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population. The queries provided here allow for the examination of infection rates, death rates, vaccination trends, and population comparisons across different countries and continents.

##  Data Exploration

The SQL queries provided in this repository help uncover key patterns and trends within the COVID-19 dataset. Here are some of the areas explored:

Total cases and total deaths: Analyzing the relationship between total cases and total deaths both globally and at the country level.
Death percentages: Calculating the percentage of deaths in relation to total cases, allowing for a better understanding of fatality rates.
Population comparisons: Investigating the percentage of the population affected by COVID-19 in specific countries, aiding in the assessment of the disease's impact.
Infection rates: Identifying countries with the highest infection rates compared to their respective populations, providing insights into the severity of the outbreak in different regions.
Vaccination analysis: Examining the relationship between total population and vaccination numbers, exploring the progress of vaccination efforts globally.
Please refer to the SQL queries provided in this repository to explore the dataset further and gain additional insights.

## Usage

To use the SQL queries, you will need access to a SQL database or environment where you can execute the queries. Simply copy the desired query and run it against the COVID-19 dataset.I'm using mysql workbench.

### Deployment

I've created a notebook to help transfer the data into mysql workbench.
